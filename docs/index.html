      <h2> Project Description </h2>
    </header>

    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Traditional health care system is supply-based and organized around providers (hospitals, medical practices, clinics, and others). In most parts of the world, population is aging and becoming less healthy due to consumerism, unhealthy diet, and sedentary life style. Health care costs are rapidly rising and there is a trend of moving health care services to patient homes as much as possible. New technologies make this possible; technology-enabled infrastructure that connects providers, caregivers and patients and links multiple sources of data. Simple collecting and connecting data are not sufficient, these data need to be coupled with medical knowledge and algorithms that help make timely and correct decisions about patient’s health needs. New technologies include sensor systems, wearables, personal health records, and the connectivity of devices through the Internet of Things. Although these technologies offer a great promise, to date no system has been shown to accurately collect data. We propose to develop and implement a system for monitoring pregnancy through integration of wearable devices, medical knowledge and relevant algorithms, and with the use of personal pregnancy record. This system takes input from continuous activity monitoring device (smart watch, heart beat, breathing rate), smart devices that are used several times a day (smart scale, blood pressure monitor, blood sugar meter, and temperature). Similar systems have been proposed but a truly functional system is not available. The system will focus on comprehensive data collection from wearable devices, linked smart devices, early detection of risks and possible complications that will trigger alarms and recommendations to see health care specialists. The system will use commercially available devices and sensors and we will focus on the development of a software system. The proposed software will be used in health monitoring (data collection, management and processing) and will provide automated support for medical decision making through application of machine learning approaches. The main aim of this project is to develop and implement a system for online analytics of pregnancy monitoring data that can be used to maintain healthy pregnancy and enable early prediction of  various complications and rapidly advise patient about the emerging risks. Our application will monitor several basic signs (weight, blood pressure, temperature, physical activity, heart rate, and sleep) and integrate these data into a decision-making system. We will focus on prediction of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia.
