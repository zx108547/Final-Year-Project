    <p>

    This project focusses on applied computer science â€“ we will use computer science techniques and methods to perform health monitoring (data collection, management and processing) and provide automated support for medical decision making through application of machine learning approaches. The main aim of this project is to develop and implement a system for online analytics of pregnancy monitoring data that can be used to predict various complications and rapidly advise patient about emerging risks. Our application will monitor several basic signs (weight, blood pressure, temperature, physical activity, heart rate, and sleep) and integrate these data into a decision-making system. We will focus on prediction of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia.
